I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Stanford Department of Epidemiology and Population Health](https://med.stanford.edu/epidemiology-dept.html) and [Stanford Center on Longevity](https://longevity.stanford.edu/), working with Professors [David Rehkopf](https://profiles.stanford.edu/david-rehkopf) and [Nilam Ram](https://cas.stanford.edu/people/nilam-ram). My interdisciplinary research draws from machine learning, biostatistics, decision science, health services research, social epidemiology and community engaged research to study how statistical models used in US primary care affect health inequities, and how to build systems which alleviate, rather than exacerbate them.

Previously, I completed a PhD in Computer Science under the supervision of Professor [Sherri Rose](http://drsherrirose.org/), and was a member of the [Health Policy Data Science Lab](http://healthpolicydatascience.org/) at the Stanford Department of Health Policy.

<!-- 
During my PhD, I was also a member of the [Shah lab](https://shahlab.stanford.edu/), a Technology & Racial Equity graduate fellow at the [Center for
Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity](https://ccsre.stanford.edu/), a [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/) graduate fellow, as well as founded and co-led the [Stanford Computing & Society group](https://computing-society.stanford.edu/).

<b> A participatory approach for understanding social drivers of chronic kidney disease progression</b>
<br>
<u>Agata Foryciarz</u>\*, Neha Srivathsa\*, Oshra Sedan, Lisa Goldman Rosas, Sherri Rose

We conducted a participatory research study to understand specific ways in which social factors
(e.g. housing, transportation, adverse experiences, access barriers, direct discrimination) impact chronic
kidney disease patients’ ability to manage their condition. In a series of focus groups (completed in
October and November 2024) and model building workshops (completed in January 2025), participants
were guided through a multi-step process of constructing a causal loop diagram representing social
factors and their interactions.
